# Suggest Post Tags

The Suggest Post Tags plugins helps you reduce the amount of tags you are using by suggesting similar, existing tags.

## How it works
Using an API, the terms you search for are looked up in the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). If you have a post tag which matches one of the Synonyms, it will be suggested.

In conclusion, if your tags not being suggested, they are likely not listed as a synonym on the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.
